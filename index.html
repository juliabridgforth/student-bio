    <p>I never allow life to be boring and I have been to every continent on Earth, except Antarctica. (I’m coming for you, penguins!) If I had to choose three people to be on my dodgeball team, it would be Troy from Community, Childish Gambino, and Donald Glover. Books, Moscow Mules, and wildflower illustrations will keep me happy into eternity. Let’s communicate through imagery and make the world a better place!

    <br />
    I am a  master's of marketing student at Vanderbilt University (graduating May  2020), where I am developing the strategic framework and arsenal of tools to create messaging that resonates with consumers. Before deciding to pursue a graduate degree, I attended The University of the South, graduating summa cum laude with a BA in environmental arts and humanities. During my undergraduate studies, I realized the power of stories in the fight for environmental and social justice. My desire to learn how to craft impactful stories led me to Circa Design, a boutique branding agency where I gained expertise in adobe creative suite and applied visual storytelling to create and strengthen brands for small businesses.</p>
